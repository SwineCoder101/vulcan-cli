# vulcan-onboarding

Use this skill for:

- First user interaction when the user wants help getting started with Vulcan
- First-time setup of vulcan
- Paper-first onboarding before live funds
- Creating and configuring a wallet
- Registering a trader account
- Making the first deposit

Do not use this skill as the general Vulcan router. The `vulcan` entry skill routes broad requests here when the user is new or needs setup.

## First Interaction

Start with a health check:

```bash
vulcan agent health -o json
```

or read:

```text
vulcan://agent/health
```

Then offer:

1. Try paper trading first. This is recommended and needs no wallet or funds.
2. Set up live trading only when the user is ready: wallet, registration, and deposit.
3. Fix environment health: agent skills, Phoenix API, Solana RPC, wallets, balances, deposited collateral, registration, or paper readiness.

By default, `agent health` checks Cursor, Claude, Codex, and the generic Agentskills/OpenClaw-compatible skill target. Use `--target` only when the user asks about a specific agent client.

Paper quick start:

```bash
vulcan paper init --balance 10000 -o json
vulcan paper buy SOL --notional-usdc 100 --type market -o json
vulcan paper status -o json
```

**Paper needs no wallet.** Do not run any of `vulcan wallet create`, `vulcan wallet set-default`, `vulcan account register`, or `vulcan margin deposit` for a user who only wants to try paper trading. The paper engine reads live prices and writes a local state file at `~/.vulcan/paper-state.json` — it never resolves a wallet and never touches Solana. If the user hits `NO_DEFAULT_WALLET` from a wallet-bound tool while in paper, the call was the bug — not the missing wallet (see [Mode-Branched Preflight](../vulcan-execution-modes/SKILL.md#mode-branched-preflight-the-no-wallet-path)). Direct them back to `vulcan paper status` and continue without setting up a wallet.

Steps 2–6 below are for **live** setup only and should not run if the user has indicated they only want paper. Surface live setup explicitly: *"Want to set up a wallet to graduate from paper to live?"* — only proceed when they say yes.

## Prerequisites

- Solana wallet with SOL (for transaction fees) and USDC (for collateral).
- Optionally, a referral code for Phoenix DEX registration (registration also works without one).

## Step 1: Install and Configure

```bash
cargo install --path vulcan    # from repo
vulcan setup                   # interactive setup wizard
vulcan agent health -o json    # readiness and next steps
vulcan agent mcp doctor --target cursor --scope user -o json
```

Setup creates `~/.vulcan/config.toml`, checks trader registration status, can complete registration with or without a referral code, and can install read-only/paper MCP config. The Phoenix API session is signed in automatically using the configured wallet — no separate login step is required.

MCP is optional for paper and dry-run usage. For agent-driven live trading, prefer dangerous MCP with an unlocked session wallet: `vulcan agent mcp install --target cursor --dangerous`. Use this only after the user accepts that `VULCAN_WALLET_PASSWORD` may live in plaintext agent config.

## Step 2: Create a Wallet

Wallet operations are CLI-only (not available via MCP):

```bash
vulcan wallet create --name <NAME>             # interactive password prompt
vulcan wallet import --name <NAME> <SOURCE>    # import existing Solana keypair
vulcan wallet list             # verify wallet created
vulcan wallet set-default <NAME>
```

## Step 3: Fund the Wallet

The wallet needs:

- **SOL** — for Solana transaction fees (~0.01 SOL per transaction). Skip this when a paymaster is linked (`vulcan wallet set-fee-payer`); then only the paymaster needs SOL.
- **USDC** — for trading collateral.

After wallet creation, give the user the wallet public key so they can fund it externally. Funding happens outside Vulcan through a wallet transfer, exchange withdrawal, or similar flow. In MCP, prefer the explicit address helper:

```
vulcan_wallet_address → {}
```

Check balances:

```
vulcan_wallet_balance → {}
```

`vulcan_wallet_balance` is wallet funds only. Trader collateral is separate USDC already deposited into Phoenix; use `vulcan_portfolio` or `vulcan agent health -o json` to view deposited collateral.

## Step 4: Register Trader Account

A referral code is optional: when the user has one, pass it; when omitted, Vulcan registers with its default referral code. The setup wizard prompts for an optional referral code interactively:

```bash
vulcan account register
vulcan account register --referral-code <CODE>
vulcan --fee-payer <SPONSOR_WALLET> account register --referral-code <CODE>
```

For MCP:

```
vulcan_account_register → { acknowledged: true }
vulcan_account_register → { referral_code: "YOUR_CODE", acknowledged: true }
```

Registration submits a signed onboarding transaction for the default cross-margin subaccount via `/v1/referral/activate-tx`; the wallet pays the transaction fee and trader-account rent, and the API adds the onboarder co-signature. If the trader is already registered, verify with `vulcan_account_info`.

**Sponsored registration (paymaster).** When the trader wallet holds no SOL, link a funded stored wallet as paymaster with `vulcan wallet set-fee-payer <SPONSOR_WALLET>` (or pass the global `--fee-payer <SPONSOR_WALLET>` for one command, or `fee_payer` in `vulcan_account_register`). The sponsor pays the fee and rent for registration and for every later transaction (deposits, trades, withdrawals); the trader wallet still co-signs, and the SOL preflight checks the sponsor's balance instead. Both wallets are unlocked with the same `VULCAN_WALLET_PASSWORD` when they are local encrypted wallets. The sponsor is validated before any network call, so a missing or same-as-trader sponsor fails immediately (`FEE_PAYER_WALLET_NOT_FOUND`, `FEE_PAYER_IS_TRADER`), and `--dry-run` reports the resolved sponsor pubkey as `fee_payer` without unlocking it.

## Step 5: Deposit Collateral

```
vulcan_margin_deposit → { amount: 100.0, acknowledged: true }
```

`amount` is in USDC. Verify with `vulcan_margin_status`; collateral should reflect the deposit and risk state should be `Healthy`.

## Step 6: Verify Everything

```
vulcan_status → {}    # checks config, wallet, RPC, API, registration
vulcan_auth_status → {} # checks shared Phoenix API session status
```

All checks should pass. If any fail, the status or health output includes recovery hints. API auth sessions are separate from wallet unlock; they improve authenticated API access but do not sign live transactions.

## Step 7: First Trade (Optional)

This is the **live** first trade — only run after Steps 2–6 are complete. For a paper first trade, use the paper quick start at the top of this skill.

Follow the safe order flow from the `vulcan-trade-execution` skill:

```
vulcan_market_info   → { symbol: "SOL" }
vulcan_market_ticker → { symbol: "SOL" }
vulcan_margin_status → {}
```

Then place a small test trade.

## Troubleshooting


| Issue                 | Fix                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NO_DEFAULT_WALLET`   | For live: `vulcan wallet set-default <name>`. For paper/dry-run: the call shouldn't have been made — switch to `vulcan_paper_*` tools and continue without a wallet. |
| `DECRYPT_FAILED`      | Wrong password. Set `VULCAN_WALLET_PASSWORD`                 |
| `NO_TRADER_ACCOUNT`   | Register with `vulcan account register`                      |
| `CONFIG_ERROR`        | Run `vulcan setup`                                           |
| Insufficient SOL      | Fund wallet with SOL for tx fees                             |
| Insufficient USDC     | Transfer USDC to wallet address                              |
